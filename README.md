# Spotify Data Analysis – Power BI Project Report

## 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Spotify music data using **Power BI** to uncover meaningful insights about **song performance, artist popularity, and listening trends**. The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive, interactive view of Spotify data across three key perspectives: **Overview, Artists, and Songs**. This analysis helps understand content performance, user preferences, and industry trends that can support data-driven decisions in music analytics.

## 2. Problem Statement (Insight-Based)

With the exponential growth of digital music platforms like Spotify, understanding which **artists and songs drive popularity**, how **content is released over time**, and what factors influence **listener engagement** has become increasingly complex. Key challenges addressed in this project include:

* Identifying the most popular artists and songs across the platform
* Understanding trends in song releases by year and month
* Analyzing differences between explicit and non-explicit content
* Comparing performance across album types (single, album, compilation)
* Evaluating song duration and popularity patterns

This project aims to solve these challenges by transforming raw Spotify data into clear, actionable insights using interactive Power BI visualizations.
